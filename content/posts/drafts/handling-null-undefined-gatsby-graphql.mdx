Have you ever seen something like this when working on a Gatsby site?

```sh
ERROR #85925  GRAPHQL

There was an error in your GraphQL query:

Cannot return null for non-nullable field timeToRead.
```

This just happened to me, but what happened and why? Let's break it down.

- `timeToRead` is a GraphQL field I use for my blog posts, it is created automatically by the [reading time plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-reading-time/). It counts the number of words in a post and calculates a reading time based on that.
- In my GraphQL schema I defined this field as 'non-nullable'; a bit like this `timeToRead: Int!`. This tells Gatsby two things about this field. That it will be a number value(`Int`). That it is non-nullable (`!`). In other words it _has_ to have a number value.
- When I saved the draft post with only frontmatter there was no markdown content for the reading time plugin to measure, so it returned null. Which isn't technically wrong.
- When Gatsby was generating the GraphQL fields it saw that `timeToRead` was null and threw the above error, saying 'Hey! You! Didn't you tell me this couldn't be null!? Ahhh! Error!'

So how do we fix this?

The quick answer is to just put a bit of text in the blog post, and boom our error goes away because it is no longer null. A better fix, so this never happens again, is to remove the exclamation point, `timeToRead: Int`. Now the field can be null, but is still required to be a number value.

Here is what an example `gatsby-node.js` file might look like:

```js
```
