I wrote my first website using only HTML - tables and iframes for the layout. 1998, folks. I have been mucking around on computers ever since, with varying amounts of focus. I remember the rage-inducing frustration of floated layouts, the ridiculous difficulty of vertically centering elements, and the revolution of responsive design. The web and I have both changed a lot over the years. Here are a few small thoughts about that change.

## Simple is better. And harder.

Simple is really damn hard. Right information, right place, right format is a serious art and skill. In the old days of multiple sidebars and complex drop-downs users were overloaded with information. Lots of progress has happened on this front and I think the web and information technology in general has come a long way forwards with this in mind.

## Wordpress is the multitool of web design

...that is also its downfall. Let me say that I owe a lot of what I know to mucking around in wordpress themes. Tweak some code, get stuck, hit google, problem solve, continue. Wordpress has its shortcomings and challenges but I also think it is important to recognize the revolution it provided in terms of accessibility and gentle introduction to web design work. I am excited to see what happens to the platform over the next 5 years as it grows and adjusts to evolving web technologies. For me, one of the fundamental problems I started to run into with wordpress was that it was too complex - like an oversized swissarmy knife full of gadgets (...plugins) when a lot of the time you just need a blade and a can opener.

## Learning backwards is really fun

I jumped into Gatsby knowing very little about javascript, and even less about react or continuous deployment. But almost immediately I had a fully functioning website that was doing some pretty nifty stuff. Stuff that just a few years ago would have taken a lot of custom work and time. Gatsby has felt like a rabbit hole for me, I am not sure where the bottom is but I just keep digging.

First I headed for CSS modules, because that was the closest thing to "normal" CSS in the javascript environment. These were awesome and solved lots of traditional CSS problems but wait...I could have design tokens beyond CSS variables with css-in-js? Cue my mind blowing up. Oh yeah, GraphQL is in here too! Then along came themes, hooks, and all sorts of more complex react features. I am still learning almost every single day.
