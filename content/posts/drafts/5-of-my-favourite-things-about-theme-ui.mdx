[Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/) has been a huge win for me, easy design tokens, quick mobile styles, and a robust component library. I build every project using theme-ui and have deeply integrated it into the [Catalyst series of themes](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst) I have worked on for Gatsby. Here are 5 of my favourite things about Theme-UI after using it heavily since almost the day it was released.

## Presets that can be used as a base theme

## SX prop

## Robust component library

## Array syntax for breakpoints

Writing traditional media queries was always a bit of a time consuming task. Do you put them all together at the end of the `style.css` file? Do you write them inline with the styles as you go? I have done both of these ways, and both had their upsides and downsides for me. Theme-UI solves this brilliantly with simple inline notation to define your media queries with ease. It took me a while to get used to this but now that I have I am not sure I could go back.

**Define your media queries in the theme file:**

```
breakpoints: ["580px", "768px", "1200px", "1440px"],
```

**Write your components using the array notation:**

```
<div sx={{
  height: "300px"
  width: "300px"
  backgroundColor: ["green", "yellow", "red", "blue", "orange"]
}}>
<p>Hello World</p>
</div>
```

The first item in the array, in this case "green" corresponds to the first breakpoint, any screen sup to 580px wide. The second item corresponds to the next breakpoint, screens between 580px and 768px, and so on.

You often have only a few modifications to make and I find it helpful to include `null` in my array to make it easier to visualize where this changes are taking effect. Something like this:

```
backgroundColor: ["green", null, null, "blue", null]
```

In this case the background color will be green from 0px to 1200px and then change to blue from 1200px and larger. The last `null` is not technically necessary howevery I do find this helps to visualize the flow of the changes.
