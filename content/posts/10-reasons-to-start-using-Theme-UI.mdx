[Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/) has been a huge productivity win for me; design tokens, inline mobile styles, a robust component library and more. I build every new project using Theme-UI and have deeply integrated it into [Catalyst themes for Gatsby](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst). Here are 10 of my favourite features of Theme-UI after using it regularly since it was publicly released.

## Consistent design system

At the heart of Theme-UI is a [theme specification file](https://theme-ui.com/theme-spec) which includes key-value pairs for CSS properties line-height, fonts, colors, etc. Where this theme specification really shines is in higher level design specifications like `space` which automatically apply to any CSS property which defines a space such as padding, margin, grid-gap, etc. Space is defined as an array of values such as `space: [0rem, 0.25rem, 0.5rem, 1rem, 2rem, 4rem]`. You can then reference these values by their array index; `margin: 0, padding: 3` is equivalent to `margin: 0rem; padding: 1rem`.

Here is a simple example:

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "theme-ui"

const Spacing = () => {
  return (
    <div
      sx={{
        margin-bottom: 3,
      }}
    >
      <div
      sx={{
        padding: 2,
      }}>
        <p>Consistency in your design is great!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Spacing
```

## Design tokens

Design tokens enable you to quickly swap colors, fonts, spacing, etc. for a website. This feature is becoming common in modern development architecture and is now possible in vanilla CSS with CSS variables. In Theme-UI there is a central "theme" file which has key-value pairs in JSON for design tokens. Swapping colors across large parts of a site is one change versus any number of changes.

Theme specification file:

```js
export default {
  colors: {
    primary: "blue",
    secondary: "green",
    },
```

Example Component:

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "theme-ui"

const ChangeColors = () => {
  return (
    <div
      sx={{
        height: "300px",
        width: "300px",
        backgroundColor: "primary",
        padding: "2rem",
      }}
    >
      <p
        sx={{
          color: "secondary",
        }}
      >
        Some Text
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default ChangeColors
```

## Array syntax for media queries

Writing media queries in CSS has always been a bit painful and longwinded for complex designs. Theme-UI offers an elegant and effective solution to this; most importantly a fast solution. You define a set of breakpoints in your theme specification file, such as `breakpoints: ["480px", "768px", "1024px"]. Then you can use an array syntax directly in your component to define the styles between each breakpoint.

Here is an example:

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from "theme-ui"

const Breakpoints = () => {
  return (
    <p
      sx={{
        // 0 - 480px: Green
        // 480px - 768px: Red
        //768px - 1024px: Red
        //1024px and up: Blue
        color: ["green", "red", null, "blue"],
      }}
    >
      That was some easy media queries!
    </p>
  )
}

export default Breakpoints
```

## Styled component

Theme-UI just works with MD and MDX files - the styles defined in the theme specification are automatically applied. However you often need to access styles outside of markdown in your components; enter the [Styled component](https://theme-ui.com/styled). This provides a way to "hook" into your Theme-UI styles from anywhere in your application. The syntax is fairly easy to remember which is a bonus - `<Styled.p>` or `<Styled.h3>` or `<Styled.ul>`.

Here is an example:

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, Styled } from "theme-ui"

const StyledFun = () => {
  return <Styled.h1>Got My Theme-UI Styles!</Styled.h1>
}

export default StyledFun
```

## Variants

Variants provide a quick way to change element styles without having to shadow or replace an entire component. Say you wanted to give your site title a new color - variants could allow you to do this without altering the original component. This gives your more freedom when building themes to enable a pathway for users to make simple changes to components without rewriting the whole file.

Original component:

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, Styled } from "theme-ui"

const SiteTitle = () => {
  return (
    <Styled.h1
      sx={{
        variant: "variants.siteTitle",
      }}
    >
      Got My Theme-UI Styles!
    </Styled.h1>
  )
}

export default SiteTitle
```

Theme specification file:

```js
export default {
  // Other styles would be in this file as well
  variants: {
    siteTitle: {
      color: "green",
    },
  }
```

## Color mode support

Theme-UI makes creating a dark mode on your website straightforward and includes excellent [documentation on color modes.](https://theme-ui.com/color-modes/). In short you define a dark color scheme in your theme using the `modes` object and then access the `useColorMode` hook from Theme-UI to change state and automatically toggle between light and dark modes on your site. You can set it to respect user preferences for dark mode and you can also define a name for the initial color mode - both of which are thoughtful additions to the color mode API.

Here is a simple example of a dark mode and light mode color scheme:

```js
export default {
  useColorSchemeMediaQuery: true,
  initialColorModeName: "light",
  colors: {
    background: "white",
    text: "black",
    modes: {
      dark: {
        background: "black",
        text: "white",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Presets as a base theme

Theme-UI provides a number of theme presets which can be used as a base theme and customized to meet your own needs. For example if you like working with Tailwind there is a [Tailwind preset](https://theme-ui.com/presets/tailwind).

Here is an example of importing a theme preset:

```js
import { tailwind } from "@theme-ui/preset-tailwind"

export default {
  ...tailwind, // Gives you the entire preset
  colors: {
    ...tailwind.colors, // Gives you the specific color presets
    background: "teal", // Overrides the default background
    primary: "blue", // Overrides the default primary color
  },
}
```

## Component library

## Code highlighting

## CSS-in-JS

Writing traditional media queries was always a bit of a time consuming task. Do you put them all together at the end of the `style.css` file? Do you write them inline with the styles as you go? I have done both of these ways, and both had their upsides and downsides for me. Theme-UI solves this brilliantly with simple inline notation to define your media queries with ease. It took me a while to get used to this but now that I have I am not sure I could go back.

**Define your media queries in the theme file:**

```
breakpoints: ["580px", "768px", "1200px", "1440px"],
```

**Write your components using the array notation:**

```
<div sx={{
  height: "300px"
  width: "300px"
  backgroundColor: ["green", "yellow", "red", "blue", "orange"]
}}>
<p>Hello World</p>
</div>
```

The first item in the array, in this case "green" corresponds to the first breakpoint, any screen sup to 580px wide. The second item corresponds to the next breakpoint, screens between 580px and 768px, and so on.

You often have only a few modifications to make and I find it helpful to include `null` in my array to make it easier to visualize where this changes are taking effect. Something like this:

```
backgroundColor: ["green", null, null, "blue", null]
```

In this case the background color will be green from 0px to 1200px and then change to blue from 1200px and larger. The last `null` is not technically necessary howevery I do find this helps to visualize the flow of the changes.
