This theme is designed for freelance writers who want a fast, easy to maintain, and elegant portfolio. The backend data is organized using [SANITY.io](https://www.sanity.io/). The front end is based on the [Catalyst series of themes](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst).

Here is are two demos of the theme in action:

- [https://www.briannasharpe.com/](https://www.briannasharpe.com/)
- [https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-writer.netlify.com/](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-writer.netlify.com/)

In this guide I assume you have some basic web development background and are familiar with Gatsby. If you are starting completely from the beginning I would recommend starting with [Gatsby's excellent tutorial series](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) and then coming back here.

## Install the theme using a starter

```sh
# create a new Gatsby site using the catalyst writer starter site
gatsby new catalyst-writer https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-starter-catalyst-writer
```

## Install SANITY.io

```sh
npm install -g @sanity/cli
```

## Initialize SANITY.io and setup Content Studio

```sh
# Move to the starter directory
cd catalyst-writer
# Move to the content studio directory
cd sanity-studio
# Initialize SANITY
sanity init
# Configure the studio - answer Y
? The current folder contains a configured Sanity studio. Would you like to reconfigure it? Y
# Register or login to SANITY following their prompts
# Create a new SANITY project
Good stuff, you're now authenticated. You'll need a project to keep your
datasets and collaborators safe and snug.
? Select project to use (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Create new project
# Give your project a name
? Your project name: Catalyst Writer
# Use the default dataset configuration - you can change this later
? Use the default dataset configuration? (Y/n) Y
# Start your studio on a localhost
sanity start
Content Studio successfully compiled! Go to http://localhost:3333
```
