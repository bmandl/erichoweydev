I built this series of themes and starters to accelerate the development process and have a modular approach for my freelance projects - my goal was to increase productivity and minimize rewriting code on every single project. [Gatsby Theme Catalyst](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst) is my opinionated view of a modern tech stack relying on a combination of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), [Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/), and [SANITY.io](https://theme-ui.com/). The themes and starters are managed in a monorepo with Github Actions and Lerna for deployment.

[Documentation](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst) is currently housed on Github in the main repository.

## How it works?

Imagine Lego. A set of interlocking blocks that connect together to create a final form.

It all starts with a solid core theme. This acts as a base layer for other themes providing package dependencies, hooks, SEO, initial plugin configurations and more.

You then pick additional themes as necessary such as a header theme and footer theme to match your site design. This provides a basic, unstyled, starting point for building a custom site. Change the colours, add branding, add content, shadow components and you are ready to go. For an example of this in action see [gatsby-starter-catalyst-basic](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-basic.netlify.com/) (raw and unstyled) and this site (styled and customized).

There are also more “complete” themes with CMS integration, custom components, and styling. These themes require less customization before being ready to go - but are also less flexible because of how tightly integrated they are. For an example of this in action you can see [gatsby-starter-catalyst-writer](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-writer.netlify.com/) (base theme) and [briannasharpe.com](https://www.briannasharpe.com/) (customized version of the base theme).

## Getting started

Example spin up of a basic site.

## Next steps for Gatsby Theme Catalyst

This project is growing and uses semantic versioning to manage future changes. Currently there a limited number of themes or “Lego blocks” to work with but I will be adding more over time and focusing on enhancements now that the core API and themes are stable.

Contributions are welcome and encouraged. If you have a suggestion or run into a problem please submit an issue on Github.

Get building!
