I built this series of themes and starters to accelerate the development process and have a modular approach for my freelance work - my goal was to increase productivity and minimize rewriting code. [Gatsby Theme Catalyst](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst) is my opinionated view of a modern tech stack relying on a combination of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), [Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/), and [SANITY.io](https://theme-ui.com/). The themes and starters are managed in a monorepo with Github Actions and Lerna for deployment.

[Documentation](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst) is currently housed on Github in the main repository.

## How it works?

Imagine Lego. A set of interlocking blocks that connect together to create a final form.

It all starts with a solid core theme. This acts as a base layer for other themes providing package dependencies, hooks, SEO, initial plugin configurations and more.

You then pick additional themes as necessary such as a header theme and footer theme to match your site design. This provides a basic, unstyled, starting point for building a custom site. Change the colours, add branding, add content, shadow components and you are ready to go. For an example of this in action see [gatsby-starter-catalyst-basic](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-basic.netlify.com/) (raw and unstyled) and this site (styled and customized).

There are also more “complete” themes with CMS integration, custom components, and styling. These themes require less customization before being ready to go - but are also less flexible because of how tightly integrated they are. For an example of this in action you can see [gatsby-starter-catalyst-writer](https://gatsby-starter-catalyst-writer.netlify.com/) (base theme) and [briannasharpe.com](https://www.briannasharpe.com/) (customized version of the base theme).

## Getting started

This will walk you through setting up a basic blog using gatsby-theme-catalyst. I assume you have a development environment already setup for Gatsby. For instructions on that please check the [GatsbyJS getting starter docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).

### 1. Use gatsby-starter-catalyst-blog to get setup

```
gatsby new catalyst-blog https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-starter-catalyst-blog
```

### 2. 'Develop' it for the first time

```
cd catalyst-blog
gatsby-develop
```

You should have something that looks like this:

### 3. Modify your gatsby-config.js file

Now we will change a few fields in the `siteMetaData` to start getting your site set up. Change the following fields to match your site, don't worry, you can change these again later easily. If you don't have a twitter account, just leave it blank.

```
title: `Catalyst Blog`,
description: `Speed up your Gatsby development workflow.`,
keywords: [`gatsby`, `theme`, `react`, `blog`],
author: `Eric Howey`,
twitter: `@erchwy`,
```

You will see an array in the `gatsby-config.js` file that is called `socialLinks`. Modify this to reflect your social media presence. It looks somethinglike this:

```
socialLinks: [
      {
        name: `Email`,
        link: `eric@erichowey.dev`,
        location: `footer`, //Options are "all", "header", "footer"
      },
      {
        name: `Github`,
        link: `https://www.github.com/ehowey`,
        location: `all`, //Options are "all", "header", "footer"
      },
    ],
```

You may also need to stop your development server by hitting `Ctrl+C` and then run `gatsby develop` again to get the changes to `gatsby-config.js` to fully take effect.

### 4. Add an about me page

In your code editor goto `content/pages` and make a new page called `about.mdx`.

Copy and paste the following text into the page and save:

```
<SEO title="About me" />

# About me

I live on the moon and like to ride rocketships.
```

Now goto `http://localhost:8000/about` and view your new page.

Next, open up `gatsby-config.js` again, and look for the section entitled `menuLinks` and modify it to include your new about page. Save the file, you may need to reload the page to see the change take effect. It should look like this when you are done:

```
menuLinks: [
      {
        name: `About`,
        link: `/about`,
        type: `internal`, //internal or anchor
      },
      {
        name: `Blog`,
        link: `/blog`,
        type: `internal`, //internal or anchor
      },
    ],
```

### 5. Add a new blog post

Create a new file called `new-post.mdx` in `content/posts`.

Add the following information to the file and save it.

```
---
title: My new post
author: My name
authorLink: https://twitter.com
date: 2020-01-05
featuredImage: ../assets/featured1.jpg
---

Here is my awesome new post
```

### 6. Change your logo

Pick any image you want, a picture of your face, a photo of your home, your actual business logo. It should be either a `.png` or `.jpg` file to work with gatsby-image. Rename this file to `catalyst-site-logo.png`(or.jpg). Place this file in `content/assets` and overwrite the existing logo file. Gatsby should automatically rebuild your site with the new logo, sometimes you need to refresh the page once for it to display properly.

### 7. Pick some better colors

The theme ships with pretty bland colors on purpose. You change these colors in the `theme.js` file located at `src/gatsby-theme-catalyst-core/theme.js`.

Try something like this in the colors object:

```
colors: {
    ...tailwind.colors,
    primary: baseColors.orange[6],
    primaryHover: baseColors.orange[8],
    secondary: baseColors.orange[6],
    accent: baseColors.blue[3],
    textWhite: baseColors.gray[1],
    header: {
      background: baseColors.blue[3],
      backgroundOpen: baseColors.blue[7],
      text: baseColors.gray[8],
      textOpen: baseColors.gray[1],
      icons: baseColors.gray[8],
      iconsHover: baseColors.orange[6],
      iconsOpen: baseColors.gray[1],
    },
    footer: {
      background: baseColors.blue[3],
      text: baseColors.gray[8],
      links: baseColors.gray[8],
      icons: baseColors.gray[8],
    },
  },
```

Now your site should look something like this:

![Catalyst Blog Screenshot 2](../assets/posts/cat-blog-screenshot-2.png "Catalyst Blog Screenshot 2")

### Deploying and beyond

This just scratches the surface of what you can do with this set of themes and starters. There is [additional documentation on github.](https://github.com/ehowey/gatsby-theme-catalyst) I would recommend using Netlify or Gatsby Cloud to deploy your project.

## Next steps for Gatsby Theme Catalyst

This project is growing and uses semantic versioning to manage future changes. Currently there a limited number of themes or “Lego blocks” to work with but I will be adding more over time and focusing on enhancements now that the core API and themes are stable.

Contributions are welcome and encouraged. If you have a suggestion or run into a problem please submit an issue on Github.

Get building!
