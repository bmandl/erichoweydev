A great feature of SANITY.io is the ability to add [custom field validation](https://www.sanity.io/docs/validation) to schema types. This can ensure data conforms to specific patterns, e.g. a ZIP code is actually a valid ZIP code or an email field is a valid email.

## Required field

The simplest type of validation - make a field required without any other custom rules.

```js
{
  name: "title",
  title: "Title",
  type: "string",
  validation: (Rule) => Rule.required(),
},
```

## RegEx Validation

This validation tests against a regex pattern. This is useful for fields like email, postal codes, and more. In this example the field can be empty BUT if the field is completed then it must meet the regex pattern. To make the field both required and match a regex pattern you can remove the first if statement that checks whether the field is undefined.

```js
{
  name: "postal",
  title: "Postal Code",
  type: "string",
  validation: (Rule) =>
    Rule.custom((postal) => {
      if (typeof postal === "undefined") {
        return true // Allow undefined values, remove if the field is required
      }
      const regex = /([ABCEGHJ-NPRSTVXY]\d[A-Z])[\s\-]?(\d[A-Z]\d)/gi // Regex pattern goes here
      if (regex.test(postal)) {
        return true
      } else {
        return "Not a valid postal code" // Error message goes here
      }
    }),
},
```

## URL validation

This validation ensures that a field is filled in with a valid url. In this example it allows relative links and also allows mailto links. Relative links can be required with the relativeOnly option.

```js
{
  name: "link",
  title: "Link",
  type: "url",
  validation: (Rule) =>
    Rule.required().uri({
      allowRelative: true, // Allow relative links
      relativeOnly: false, // Force only relative links
      scheme: ["https", "http", "mailto"], // Default is ["https", "http"]
    }),
},
```
