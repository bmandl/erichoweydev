You should know two things about me before you read this article. I write from a place of significant social privelege, my experiences are not reflective of everyone's experiences. I work full time in Canada as a mental health therapist and have a Masters in Social Work degree.

I was at a training recently where the presenter talked about the concept of "professional self-doubt" in relation to therapeutic effectiveness. It turns out that low-moderate degrees of professional self-doubt are actually associated with better therapeutic outcomes (Nissen-Lie, Helene A., 2017). When therapists are less certain we do a better job. Relatedly, research has also shown that therapists do their best work at the very start of their career or even when they are students (reference).

The presenter went on to show an interview with one of the best therapists in the world according to their large research study. What do you imagine they looked like or acted like?

She was a quiet, unassuming and humble British woman, she smiled often, laughed easily, and was very relaxed in her body language. In her work with clients she encourages them to give her critical feedback and spoke about often doubting her own work and abilities. She is one of the best therapists in the world but does not act like it or feel like it.

What if some of the same things are true about feeling like an imposter in computer programming and software development? What if _sometimes_ feeling like an imposter makes you a better developer?

In discussing why self-doubt might make someone a better therapist Nissen-Lie et al., write that:

Clinicians work more effectively when they are more conscious of challenges and uncertainties of their work and less ‘blinded’ by their own competence: Therapists who are more aware of their natural limitations, and more realistic about the likelihood of poorer client outcomes, are more alert to indications that their clients are “off-track”, enabling them more frequently to resolve barriers to therapeutic progress.
