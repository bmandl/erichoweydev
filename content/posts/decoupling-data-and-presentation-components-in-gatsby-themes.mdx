When building a Gatsby theme it is best practice to separate data queries from presentation components. This separation of concerns enables a happy path for component shadowing in the finished production site.

Keep in mind that to do this you also need to [control the page creation process](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-seven/) in `gatsby-node`. The following example is theoretical - sorry no copy and paste code here! How page components are structured depends too much on a unique set of data sources and other components in a theme. There is however a link to a working example at the end of the post to help further demonstrate this concept in action.

Here is the file structure:

```text
└── src
    ├── components
    │   ├── queries
    │   │   ├── page-query.js
    │   │
    │   ├── templates
    │   │   ├── page-template.js
```

The data fetching component could look like this:

```jsx
// page-query.js
import React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"
import Page from "../templates/page-template"

export default ({ data }) => {
  return <Page data={{ ...data }} />
}

export const query = graphql`
  query PageQuery($id: String!) {
    sitePage(id: { eq: $id }) {
      id
      title
      body
    }
  }
`
```

Notice that data is passed down to the presentation component as a prop. So, as long as you give the presentation component the same data structure the component will continue to work. It doesn't care _where_ the data comes from, it cares _how_ it is structured. This means you can switch a data source (e.g. markdown to a headless CMS) by shadowing a data component and passing the same data structure down to the presentation component.

The presentational page component could then look like this, all this component needs is a title and a body - from _any_ source:

```jsx
// page-template.js
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, Styled } from "theme-ui"
import { SEO, Layout } from "gatsby-theme-catalyst-core"

const PageTemplate = ({ data }) => {
  const page = data.sitePage
  return (
    <Layout>
      <SEO title={page.title} />
      <Styled.h1>{page.title}</Styled.h1>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ page.body }} />
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default PageTemplate
```

Congratulations you have now decoupled the data and presentational components in your theme. This gives you the power to modify one - or both - without worrying about breaking your site!

You can see a great example of this principal in action by exploring how [gatsby-theme-blog-core](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog-core) and [gatsby-theme-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog) are structured together. `gatsby-theme-blog-core` provides decoupled data and presentation components which are then shadowed in `gatsby-theme-blog` to enable a full working blog without having to touch the data source!

As a closing note you should also be considering using a [hook for accessing site metadata](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/use-static-query/#composing-custom-usestaticquery-hooks) within a theme. This follows the same principal of separating data queries from other components.

Happy coding!
